# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

In this project the following files are available:

 1. a tidy data set as described below
 2. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
 3. This README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

This dataset is about one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

In this project a file is produced called "run_analysis.R"
In that file all steps are done to perform the tasks for this project.
Within the R-file comments are made to explain the flow.

The tasks for the project where:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

All tasks are preformed within the run_analysis.R file, but not neccessary in the order given above.
